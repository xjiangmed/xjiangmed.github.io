I am a third-year PhD student at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. [Kwang-Ting (Tim) Cheng](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng). I received my bachelor's degree in 2019 and my master's degree in 2022 from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. [Xin Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/xinyang). Currently, my research interests include medical image analysis and computer vision.
